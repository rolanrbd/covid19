# covid19
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been looking for an app that in a practical way can help control this pandemic, but truly I have not found it, only apps that keep a record of the statistics. I have written and designed the first ideas of one app that can contribute in a practical way. I have never developed an Android app and I don't think there is time to learn right now. So I turn to this community with this idea and if you think is a good idea then we get down to work.</p>
<p>The main ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The app will keep track of where the person has walked creating local files for each day in a maximum of 15 or 20 days, always deleting the oldest.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o This implies that the location service must always be activated on the phone.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a person is diagnosed with COVID19 +, he will press a button that will upload the routes he has traveled on to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o The server will notify these routes to everyone in the same city of the latest covid19+ cases.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o Locally in each mobile, a local algorithm will be executed that will analyze the routes by which the user has walked with those received from the server.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">o In case of coincidence in any sections, the algorithm will notify the owner that he has traveled through an unsafe route that must be quarantined.</p>
<ul>
<li>The app will always be running in the background, displaying the user's position and highlighting the risk routes in red and sounding an alarm when the user enters a risk route</li>
<li>The app will also emit an alarm if the person is less than 3 meters away from another person who has the app installed.</li>
<li>The app will display in its interface messages in the form of images and videos of tips to avoid contracting or spreading the virus.</li>
<li>It will have a graph of local cases.</li>
<li>You will have the option to call 911 or an emergency phone in case your symptoms worsen.</li>
<li>You will have direct access to the phone number for the food supply bank if one exists locally.</li>
<li>It will have a media library with instructional videos of symptoms and elements that help to understand the disease and how to avoid contagion.</li>
<li>The user will be able to keep track of their symptoms and compare how serious their condition is.</li>
<li>No personal data will be necessary, the personal configuration will be minimal such as the home address so that when notifying a COVID + the server can notify all those who live near or in the same building o neighborhood.</li>
<li>The app must be able to be translated into several languages ​​and all the analysis of the routes will be done locally so as not to load the server. The user only will receive routes of the same city o the city where he is leading into.</li>
</ul>
