table;covid19_facts;rows;20
Fact;You may be asymptomatic for up to 9 days or the entire period of illness
Fact;An asymptomatic healthy person walking down the street can leave between 3,000 and 4,000 points of infection!!!
Fact;Some very young, perfectly healthy suddenly get very sick and die from this disease (Several cases in France)
Fact;The virus is ten times higher in the elderly compared to the middle-aged.
Fact;Patients with cardiovascular disease were at the highest risk of death, followed by diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and hypertension.
Fact;Patients with obesity, heart disease, lung disease and smokers with a history of lung disease are heightened risk of developing complications related to the virus.
Myth;The new coronavirus can be transmitted through products manufactured in China.
Fact;Even though the virus can linger on surfaces for a few hours after contact, the WHO said it’s very unlikely it will persist on that surface after being moved, shipped, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. For anyone concerned a surface has been contaminated, the health agency advises cleaning it with a disinfectant. If someone has already touched it before it’s been cleaned, they should immediately wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water.
Myth;Cold weather and snow can kill the new coronavirus.
Fact;The WHO said there’s no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases, for that matter. The health agency said external temperatures or weather don’t change the human body’s normal temperature of around 36.5 to 37 C. In addition to this, the WHO said taking a hot bath will also not prevent infection for the same reason.
Myth;Pets can spread the new coronavirus.
Fact;According to the WHO, there is still no evidence to suggest that companion animals and pets, such as dogs or cats, can be infected by the virus. Despite this, people should always wash their hands with soap after touching any pets because they could spread other bacteria, such as E. coli and salmonella.
Myth;Eating garlic will prevent infection.
Fact;While it may have some antimicrobial properties, the WHO said there is no evidence from the current COVID-19 outbreak to suggest that eating garlic will protect people from the virus.
Myth;Younger people are not susceptible to COVID-19.
Fact;Older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, appear to be more vulnerable to illness caused by the new coronavirus, but the WHO said people of all ages can contract it. The health agency recommends that people of all ages take precautionary measures, such as washing their hands.
Myth;Heat can kill the virus.
Fact;The WHO advises that heat sources, such as hand dryers, are not effective at killing the virus. Further to that, ultraviolet (UV) lamps should also not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body.
Myth;Antibiotics can prevent and treat the new coronavirus.
Fact;According to the WHO, antibiotics do not work against viruses, such as COVID-19. They are only effective in working against bacteria and should not be used a means of prevention or treatment. However, someone who is treated in hospital for COVID-19 may be given antibiotics because “bacterial co-infection” is a possibility, the health agency said.
